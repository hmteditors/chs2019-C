**Euphorbos & The Cow** (trans. Wieke Snoeij + help from Dr. T.A. van Berkel)

*"He compares everything; the mass of the Trojans is compared to the whole herd; and Euphorbos being the best one is compared to the best [cow] of them. That he is the best one, the poet testifies: “after he had stood over Patroklos, he wounded the best of the Trojans:” (Hom. Il. 17.80) The killer Menelaos is compared to the lion, the inaction of the chief of the Trojans compares to herdsmen and dogs not being able to defend [the herd]."*

**Euphorbos as a Cow**

"Εὔφορβος" means well-fed -> Naturally, well-fed Euphorbos is the best cow of the "Trojan Herd" noted by the scribe.
