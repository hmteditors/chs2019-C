**Forgotten Lines**

The [Upsilon 1.1](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:e3bifolio.v1:E3_225v_226r@0.01451,0.4469,0.1631,0.07496&urn=urn:cite2:hmt:e3bifolio.v1:E3_225v_226r@0.1811,0.6443,0.2907,0.08042) scribe left lines 67 & 68 out of the main body text on 225v.

**Venetus B**

The [Venetus B](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:vbbifolio.v1:vb_232v_233r@0.1820,0.2012,0.2963,0.5226) scribe included all 24 lines on this page.

---

**Possible Explanation**

Similarity between several lines. This is an easy mistake to make.

These lines visible in Venetus B.

How standard is the number of lines per page?  We counted some!

**Euphorbos & The Cow** (trans. Wieke Snoeij + help from Dr. T.A. van Berkel)

*"He compares everything; the mass of the Trojans is compared to the whole herd; and Euphorbos being the best one is compared to the best [cow] of them. That he is the best one, the poet testifies: “after he had stood over Patroklos, he wounded the best of the Trojans:” (Hom. Il. 17.80) The killer Menelaos is compared to the lion, the inaction of the chief of the Trojans compares to herdsmen and dogs not being able to defend [the herd]."*

No comment on this line in Venetus A.  **but**...  marked as simile number 139

**Euphorbos as a Cow**

"Εὔφορβος" means well-fed -> Naturally, well-fed Euphorbos is the best cow of the "Trojan Herd" noted by the scribe.

What do these two points suggest:

- Evidence from ten pages: Ven. A and Upsilon 1.1 have the same # of lines per page. Most pages have 24 or 25 lines.

- Both scribes are likely copying from the same manuscript, but had different interests.
  - The Venetus A scribe may have had access to a book of notes on Iliad similes. (Simile 139)

- Another possibility: The Venetus A scribe didn't think the simile needed any explanation.
